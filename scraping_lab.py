# SCRAPING LAB 
# (20pts)
# Below is a link to a 10-day weather forecast at weather.com
# Use requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the weather table.
# Print a synopsis of the weather for the next 10 days by grabbing each of the following:
# Day, date, description, high and low temp, chance of rain, and wind. (2pts each)
# Print the weather for each of the next 10 days to the user in readable sentences.
# You can customize the text as you like, but it should be readable as a sentence without errors. (10pts)
# You will need to target specific classes or other attributes to pull some parts of the data.
# Sample sentence:  
# Wednesday, April 4 will be Partly Cloudy/Windy with a High of 37 degrees and a low of 25, humidity at 52%.  There is 0% chance of rain with winds out of the WNW at 22 mph.

# Note: Although it is possible to pull a description of the weather which includes much of this data, that is not the intent.
# However, if you can do it and add the additional info, that works for me.

# MY SOLE REMAINING ISSUE
# On the first day, The Weather Channel seems to have taken out the value for a high temp. That is, the
# high reads as "--/36" which messes with my program because the program splices at the "째" sign. Was today weird, or do
# they always do this? Is it really so important that I go off and deal with it separately? I say no...
